## How to Start 

1. **Start MainScene** - Open the MainScene in Unity
2. **Choose Gameplay Mode** - Select between:
   - **Mode 1**: Rhythm Tap (60 BPM, difficulty scaling enabled)
   - **Mode 2**: Performance Mode (120 BPM, vocal gate enabled)
3. **Auto Return** - After song ends, automatically returns to main menu

## Features

- **Rhythm Gameplay**: Press piano keys in sequence as notes fall down the screen
- **Piano Keyboard Interface**: 8-key piano layout (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C)
- **Progressive Difficulty**: BPM increases by +10 after 4 consecutive hits, decreases by -10 after 3 consecutive misses
- **Configurable Settings**: Hit window and BPM can be changed via RemoteConfig.json without rebuilding
- **JSON Logging**: Console output for note_hit, note_miss, and song_end events with piano key information
- **SOLID Architecture**: Clean, maintainable code following SOLID principles
- **No MonoBehaviour Dependencies**: Core services are pure C# classes for better testability
- **FPS Counter**: Simple plug-and-play performance monitoring
- **Modular Features**: Pluggable game feature system for easy customization

## Gameplay

The game follows a **falling note rhythm game** pattern similar to Guitar Hero or Rock Band:

1. **Notes fall down** from the top of the screen in lanes
2. **Piano keys** are displayed at the bottom (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K keys)
3. **Player presses the correct piano key** when the note reaches the target line
4. **Timing matters** - hit the key at the right moment for better scores
5. **Progressive difficulty** - BPM increases/decreases based on performance

### Controls
- **A Key** â†’ C note (Index 0)
- **S Key** â†’ D note (Index 1)  
- **D Key** â†’ E note (Index 2)
- **F Key** â†’ F note (Index 3)
- **G Key** â†’ G note (Index 4)
- **H Key** â†’ A note (Index 5)
- **J Key** â†’ B note (Index 6)
- **K Key** â†’ C note (Index 7)

## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Interfaces (`Assets/Scripts/Core/`)
- `IAudioService` - Unified audio system (beat sync, music transport, stem mixing, click track, SFX)
- `IBeatSyncSource` - DSP clock synchronization
- `IMusicTransport` - Song playback control
- `IStemMixer` - Individual stem volume control
- `IClickTrack` - Metronome/beat click playback
- `ISfxService` - Sound effects and instant feedback
- `IConductor` - Song timing and BPM control
- `INoteTimeline` - Note data and queries
- `IInputReader` - Piano key input handling
- `IJudgeService` - Note judgment and hit windows
- `IScoringService` - Score, combo, and streak tracking
- `IEventLogger` - JSON event logging
- `IStaffDrawer` - Musical staff and beat line rendering

### Feature System (`Assets/Scripts/Features/`)
- `IGameFeature` - Pluggable gameplay mechanics interface
- `FeatureManager` - Coordinates and manages game features
- `GameContext` - Provides service references to features
- `VocalGateFeature` - Mutes/unmutes vocal stem based on performance
- `DifficultyScalerFeature` - Adjusts BPM based on hit/miss streaks

### Service Hub (`Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/`)
- `ServiceHub` - Central coordinator for all game services
- **Global Services**: AudioService, EventLogger (initialized once)
- **GamePlay Services**: Conductor, NoteTimeline, InputReader, JudgeService, ScoringService, NoteSpawner, StaffDrawer (rebuilt per level)

### Implementation Classes

#### Pure C# Services (No MonoBehaviour)
- `JudgeService` - Judges note hits based on timing (Pure C# class)
- `ScoringService` - Tracks score, combo, and streaks (Pure C# class)

#### MonoBehaviour Services (Unity Integration)
- `UnityAudioService` - Audio implementation using Unity's audio system
- `Conductor` - Manages song timing and BPM changes (MonoBehaviour)
- `NoteTimeline` - Handles note data and spawning (MonoBehaviour)
- `InputReader` - Processes piano key input (MonoBehaviour)
- `EventLogger` - Logs game events as JSON (MonoBehaviour)
- `GameManager` - Orchestrates all game systems using ServiceHub (MonoBehaviour)
- `NoteSpawner` - Manages visual note objects (MonoBehaviour)
- `NoteObject` - Individual note behavior and visuals (MonoBehaviour)
- `GameUI` - User interface management (MonoBehaviour)
- `GamePlayUI` - In-game UI elements (judgment display, mode/streak info)
- `PianoKeyDisplay` - Visual piano key buttons with event system
- `FPSCounter` - Simple performance monitoring (MonoBehaviour)

## Key Architectural Benefits

- **Mixed Service Types**: Core game logic services (JudgeService, ScoringService) are pure C# classes, while system coordination services (ServiceHub, GameManager) use MonoBehaviour for Unity integration
- **Interface-Based Design**: All core services are defined as interfaces (IAudioService, IConductor, INoteTimeline, etc.), making them easily mockable and testable
- **Better Testability**: Pure C# services can be easily unit tested without Unity dependencies, and interface-based design allows for easy mocking in tests
- **Cleaner Dependencies**: Core services don't inherit from MonoBehaviour, reducing coupling
- **Event-Driven**: All systems communicate through events, maintaining loose coupling
- **Piano-Focused**: Input system designed specifically for piano key rhythm gameplay
- **Modular Features**: Pluggable feature system for easy gameplay customization
- **Service Separation**: Clear distinction between global and gameplay services

## Configuration

### Game Settings (`Assets/StreamingAssets/RemoteConfig.json`)
```json
{
  "initialBPM": 120.0,
  "hitWindow": 0.2,
  "minBPM": 60.0,
  "maxBPM": 200.0
}
```

### Level Configuration (`Assets/Resources/LevelConfigs/`)
- **LevelConfig1.asset** - Rhythm Tap mode (60 BPM, difficulty scaling enabled)
- **LevelConfig2.asset** - Performance mode (54 BPM, vocal gate enabled)

### Global Settings (`Assets/Scripts/Core/GlobalSetting.cs`)
- **UnitsPerBeatBase**: Base movement speed (3f)
- **HitLineX0**: Hit line X position (0f)
- **CleanupBeats**: Note cleanup timing (2.0f)
- **VerticalSpacing**: Note spacing (0.8f)
- **BaseYPosition**: Base Y position (0.0f)

**Note**: GlobalSetting automatically loads from Resources folder on boot and provides static access to these values throughout the project.

### Settings Explained
- `initialBPM`: Starting tempo of the song (now configured per level in LevelConfig)
- `hitWindow`: Time window (in seconds) for hitting notes
- `minBPM`: Minimum BPM limit for difficulty scaling
- `maxBPM`: Maximum BPM limit for difficulty scaling

## Chart Format

Charts are simple text files that define note timing and piano keys. The format is:

```
beat,type,duration,pianoKeyIndex
```

### Format Details
- **beat**: Timing in beats (e.g., 0.0, 1.0, 2.0)
- **type**: Note type (Tap, Hold, or Slide)
- **duration**: How long to hold (for Hold notes, 0.0 for Tap notes)
- **pianoKeyIndex**: Which piano key (0-7) this note corresponds to

### Example Chart
```
# Test Chart for Doulingo Music Piano Game
# Format: beat,type,duration,pianoKeyIndex
0.0,Hold,1.0,1
8.5,Hold,1.0,1
10.5,Hold,1.0,1
12.5,Hold,1.0,0
```

### Piano Key Mapping
- **Index 0**: C note (A key)
- **Index 1**: D note (S key)
- **Index 2**: E note (D key)
- **Index 3**: F note (F key)
- **Index 4**: G note (G key)
- **Index 5**: A note (H key)
- **Index 6**: B note (J key)
- **Index 7**: C note (K key)

**Note**: Lane positions are calculated automatically based on piano key index - no need to specify x,y,z coordinates!

## Dependencies

- Unity 2022.3 LTS or later
- TextMeshPro (included with Unity)
- DOTween (for animations)
- No external packages required

## Testing & Testability

The project is designed with testing in mind through interface-based architecture:

### **Interface-Based Design**
- **All core services are interfaces**: `IAudioService`, `IConductor`, `INoteTimeline`, `IInputReader`, etc.
- **Easy mocking**: Services can be easily mocked in unit tests without Unity dependencies
- **Dependency injection**: Components depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- **Testable game logic**: Core game mechanics can be tested without Unity runtime

### **Testing Examples**
- **JudgeService**: Pure C# class implementing `IJudgeService` - can test hit window logic independently
- **ScoringService**: Pure C# class implementing `IScoringService` - can test combo/streak logic independently
- **GameManager**: Can be tested with mock services by creating a `TestableGameManager` that takes interfaces as constructor parameters

### **Testing Benefits**
- **Unit testing**: Test individual service logic without Unity
- **Integration testing**: Test service interactions using mock implementations
- **Faster feedback**: No need to run Unity for logic testing
- **CI/CD friendly**: Tests can run in headless environments

## Development

The project is designed to be easily extensible:

- Add new note types by extending the `NoteType` enum
- Implement new judgment systems by extending `IJudgeService`
- Add new scoring mechanics through `IScoringService`
- Create custom charts by following the chart format specification
- Add new features by implementing `IGameFeature`
- **Interface-based services**: Easy to extend and test
- **Mockable dependencies**: All services can be mocked for testing
- Piano key system can be extended for more keys or different instruments
